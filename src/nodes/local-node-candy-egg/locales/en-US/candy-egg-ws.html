<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="CANDY EGG websocket in">
    <p>WebSocket input node, coming from CANDY EGG</p>
    <p>This node represents a data source from a CANDY EGG cloud environment. It can emit the data coming from the cloud over the WebScoket to the output port.</p>
    <p>By default, the data received from the WebSocket will be in <b>msg.payload</b>.
    The socket can be configured to expect a properly formed JSON string, in which
    case it will parse the JSON and send on the resulting object as the entire message.</p>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="CANDY EGG websocket out">
    <p>WebSocket out node, outgoing to CANDY EGG</p>
    <p>This node represents a data destination to a CANDY EGG cloud environment. It can receive the data transferring to the cloud over the WebScoket from the input port.</p>
    <p>By default, <b>msg.payload</b> will be sent over the WebSocket. The socket
    can be configured to encode the entire message object as a JSON string and send that
    over the WebSocket.</p>

    <p>If the message arriving at this node started at a WebSocket In node, the message
    will be sent back to the client that triggered the flow. Otherwise, the message
    will be broadcast to all connected clients.</p>
    <p>If you want to broadcast a message that started at a WebSocket In node, you
    should delete the <b>msg._session</b> property within the flow</p>.
