<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="CANDY EGG websocket in">
    <p>WebSocket input node, for incoming messages from CANDY EGG cloud environment.</p>
    <p>This node represents a data source from a CANDY EGG cloud environment. The node emits the data coming from the cloud over the WebScoket through its output port.</p>
	<p>Prior to using this node, you need to set up your CANDY EGG account as well as the WebScoket endpoint path.</p>
    <p>By default, the data received from the WebSocket will be in <b>msg.payload</b>.
    The socket can be configured to expect a properly formed JSON string, in which
    case it will parse the JSON and send on the resulting object as the entire message.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="CANDY EGG websocket out">
    <p>WebSocket out node, for outgoing messages to CANDY EGG cloud environment.</p>
    <p>This node represents a data destination to a CANDY EGG cloud environment. The node trasfers the data to the cloud over the WebScoket whenever it receives the data from its input port.</p>
	<p>Prior to using this node, you need to set up your CANDY EGG account as well as the WebScoket endpoint path.</p>
    <p>By default, <b>msg.payload</b> will be sent over the WebSocket. The socket
    can be configured to encode the entire message object as a JSON string and send that
    over the WebSocket.</p>

    <p>If the message arriving at this node started at a WebSocket In node, the message
    will be sent back to the client that triggered the flow. Otherwise, the message
    will be broadcast to all connected clients.</p>
    <p>If you want to broadcast a message that started at a WebSocket In node, you
    should delete the <b>msg._session</b> property within the flow</p>.
</script>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="candy-egg-ws-client">
   <p>This configuration node connects a WebSocket client to the specified CANDY EGG environment.</p>
