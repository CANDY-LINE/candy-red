    <p>By default, the data received from the WebSocket will be in <b>msg.payload</b>.

    <p>By default, <b>msg.payload</b> will be sent over the WebSocket. The socket
    can be configured to encode the entire message object as a JSON string and send that
    over the WebSocket.</p>

    <p>If the message arriving at this node started at a WebSocket In node, the message
    will be sent back to the client that triggered the flow. Otherwise, the message
    will be broadcast to all connected clients.</p>
    <p>If you want to broadcast a message that started at a WebSocket In node, you
    should delete the <b>msg._session</b> property within the flow</p>.
