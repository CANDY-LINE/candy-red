<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="CANDY EGG http request">
    <p>Provides a node for making http requests to CANDY EGG Endpoint.</p>
    <p>You need to create an endpoint with a Node-RED <code>http</code> input node in your flow on your CANDY EGG cloud enviornment and deploy the flow in order for this node to connect to the cloud environment.</p>
    <p>The URL path and HTTP method can be configured in the node, if they are left blank they should be set in an incoming message on <code>msg.method</code>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>path</code>, if set, is used as the url path of the request.</li>
        <li><code>method</code>, if set, is used as the HTTP method of the request.
        Must be one of <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PATCH</code> or <code>DELETE</code> (default: GET)</li>
        <li><code>headers</code>, if set, should be an object containing field/value
        pairs to be added as request headers</li>
        <li><code>payload</code> is sent as the body of the request</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When configured within the node, the path property can contain <a href="http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html" target="_new">mustache-style</a> tags. These allow the
    url path to be constructed using values of the incoming message. For example, if the path is set to
    <code>path?topic={{{topic}}}</code>, it will have the value of <code>msg.topic</code> automatically inserted.
    Using {{{...}}} prevents mustache from escaping characters like / & etc.</p>
    <p>
    The output message contains the following properties:
    <ul>
        <li><code>payload</code> is the body of the response</li>
        <li><code>statusCode</code> is the status code of the response, or the error code if the request could not be completed</li>
        <li><code>headers</code> is an object containing the response headers</li>
    </ul>
</script>
